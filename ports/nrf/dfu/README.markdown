# Bootloader/DFU

This is a small bootloader/DFU (device firmware updater) for nRF5x chips that
can do over-the-air firmware updates. It works at least on the nRF51822 with
s110 and on nRF52832 with s132, but other chips/SoftDevices will be easy to add
or may already work. The main advantage (besides its very small size) is that
this DFU can be installed to the MBR region of the SoftDevice, not just in the
bootloader area like the official [Nordic DFU example](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.sdk5.v14.1.0%2Fexamples_bootloader.html&cp=4_0_0_4_4).
There it won't take up any extra space as the MBR is a required component of the
system but the main thing it does is simply forwarding interrupts.

## DFU in MBR

A feature (which as far as I'm aware doesn't exist in other nRF5x bootloaders)
is that it can also be stored in the MBR region. In this mode, it receives all
interrupts but forwards all of them to the SoftDevice (except for the reset
handler). MBR SVCalls and other bootloaders are not (yet) supported when
installed this way. The advantage is that it doesn't take up any extra space as
the MBR is a required system component of recent SoftDevices.

This is the best supported configuration. It appears to work reliably and
doesn't seem to affect SoftDevice operation.

## DFU in bootloader

Originally this DFU was written as a conventional bootloader, targeting a code
size of â‰¤1kB (the flash page erase size of nRF51 chips). It should still work,
but hasn't been well maintained. More importantly, MicroPython hasn't been
adjusted to reserve this space for a bootloader so using it will lead to data
corruption when the internal filesystem is used or the application is very
large.

## Usage

In normal operation, it immediately jumps to MicroPython. But from MicroPython
there is a call (`machine.reset(1)`) which resets with a flag to stay in DFU
mode. It will broadcast a DFU service UUID so nearby updaters can connect and
push the update.

## Installing

The DFU is disabled by default. It can be enabled by passing a `DFU=mbr` flag to
the Makefile.

For example:

    make BOARD=foo SD=s1XX DFU=mbr

Or, to store the DFU in the bootloader:

    make BOARD=foo SD=s1XX DFU=bootloader

You can either separately flash the DFU (`build-*/dfu_mbr.hex` or
`build-*/dfu_bootloader.hex`) or flash the DFU as part of a combined
firmware.hex file (`build-*/firmware.hex`). The latter can push the while
firmware at once.

Some notes:

  * For MBR mode, if you flash the DFU manually, you have to flash it *after*
    flashing the SoftDevice as it overwrites a part of the SoftDevice. So on
    every SoftDevice update, you'll need to re-flash the DFU.
  * For bootloader mode to work, a UICR register needs to be set. This register
    is part of the .hex file and will be set at a flash so you can usually just
    ignore it. However, if you move or remove the bootloader you'll need to
    erase this register (which usually means erasing the whole flash).
  * This should be obvious, but the DFU depends on a functioning SoftDevice.
    This means, for example, that you cannot update the SoftDevice using the DFU
    (but it should be possible to work around that by writing an application
    that overwrites the SoftDevice at first run).

## Bluetooth API

It advertizes a service (`67fc0001-83ae-f58c-f84b-ba72efb822f4`) with two
characteristics: an info characteristic with various parameters (flash size,
page size, application start address, etc.) and a write/notify characteristic
for calls and return values. With that, an application can erase pages and write
new pages. Finally, it can call a reset to enter the bootloader.

There is no verification of any kind implemented yet. Security relies on the
fact that the bootloader can only be entered via a command in the running
firmware or as long as the first page of the firmware (the ISR vector) is
cleared.

## Optimizations

To get to this low size, some optimizations are implemented, some of which
are somewhat dangerous.

  * Code immediately follows the ISR vector.
  * Product anomalies are ignored. If they are relevant to the bootloader, they
    can be implemented.
  * Memory regions are not enabled by default. With the initial values (after
    reset) they are already enabled. This should be safe as long as no reset
    happens while memory regions are disabled.

For bootloader mode, some other optimizations have been implemented:

  * The ISR vector is shortened to 4 words, saving a lot of space. This includes
    the initial stack pointer and the HardFault handler. Other interrupts should
    not happen, I hope.
  * There is no `.data` section on the nRF51. Instead, all global values should
    either be constant (stored in `.text` in flash) or zero (stored in `.bss`
    and initialized by the startup code). The `.bss` segment is initialized,
    however. Most of the time, avoiding gobal non-const data saves code size
    anyway.  
    For MBR mode, it cannot use data in flash as the SoftDevice won't accept
    addresses in that area (< 0x1000), so they all have to be stored in RAM.

Still, there are some more optimizations that can be done to get to a lower
size:

  * SVC functions (all `sd_` calls) are currently implemented in a separate
    function. It is possible to inline those, or at least some of them. As a
    `svc` instruction is just 2 bytes and a function call is 4 bytes + the
    function itself (another 4 bytes), inlined SVC functions are always more
    efficient. it should be possible to save about 100 bytes this way.
  * The end of the compiled `Reset_Handler` (which contains most functions,
    inlined) contains a list of linker-inserted pointers to constants in `.data`
    and `.bss`. It should be possible to avoid some of those by putting those
    objects in a single container struct so the compiler will be able to write
    more efficient LDR instructions using a single or a few base pointers. This
    may save about 50 bytes.
